UVSim simulates running a BasicML script. All files imported into UVSim should be written in standard BasicML format with a maximum of 100 registers.

How to install and run UVSim:
1. Make sure you have Python installed and set up on your computer.
2. Download the "program" folder.

  If importing a pre-written program:
    1. Click "Import .txt File" and select your BasicML file.
    2. Click "Load Selected Program"
    3. Make any needed changes to the BasicML program. Note: if any changes are made, you must save them by clicking "Save Program Changes" then repeat steps 1 and 2 before the BasicML script will run with the changes.
    4. Click "Run Progam" to run the BasicML script.
  
  If writing a new BasicML program in UVSim:
