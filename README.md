# Milestone 2

I/O operation:
READ = 10 Read a word from the keyboard into a specific location in memory.
WRITE = 11 Write a word from a specific location in memory to screen.

Load/store operations:
LOAD = 20 Load a word from a specific location in memory into the accumulator.
STORE = 21 Store a word from the accumulator into a specific location in memory.

Arithmetic operation:
ADD = 30 Add a word from a specific location in memory to the word in the accumulator (leave the result in the accumulator)
SUBTRACT = 31 Subtract a word from a specific location in memory from the word in the accumulator (leave the result in the accumulator)
DIVIDE = 32 Divide the word in the accumulator by a word from a specific location in memory (leave the result in the accumulator).
MULTIPLY = 33 multiply a word from a specific location in memory to the word in the accumulator (leave the result in the accumulator).

Control operation:
BRANCH = 40 Branch to a specific location in memory
BRANCHNEG = 41 Branch to a specific location in memory if the accumulator is negative.
BRANCHZERO = 42 Branch to a specific location in memory if the accumulator is zero.
HALT = 43 Stop the program

Documents needed: 
- document that describes the high-level functionality of the application:
    - will need at least 2 User Stories and 10-15 use cases outlining the functionality of the application
- working prototype
- unit tests file
- spreadsheet that contains a description of all the unit tests
