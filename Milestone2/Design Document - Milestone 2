High level functionality:
This program, UVsim, will read in a text file containing a basicML program written one command per line. Each basicML command will be a four-digit signed word. UVsim will convert the first two digits into one of 12 operations. The second two will be an operand. The operations include: 10-read, 11-write, 20-load, 21-store, 30-add, 31-subtract, 32-divide, 33-multiply, 40-branch, 41-branchneg, 42-branchzero, and 43-halt.
User Stories:
“As a student, I want to be able to write programs in basicML and have a virtual machine interpret my program, so that I can learn basic programming skills in basicML.”
“ As a teacher, I want to have a tool that I can use to teach basicML and computer architecture ideas, so that students can have a better understanding of coding and the underlying machine language.”
