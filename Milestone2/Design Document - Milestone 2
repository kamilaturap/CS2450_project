High level functionality:
This program, UVsim, will read in a text file containing a basicML program written one command per line. Each basicML command will be a four-digit signed word. UVsim will convert the first two digits into one of 12 operations. The second two will be an operand. The operations include: 10-read, 11-write, 20-load, 21-store, 30-add, 31-subtract, 32-divide, 33-multiply, 40-branch, 41-branchneg, 42-branchzero, and 43-halt.
User Stories:
“As a student, I want to be able to write programs in basicML and have a virtual machine interpret my program, so that I can learn basic programming skills in basicML.”
“ As a teacher, I want to have a tool that I can use to teach basicML and computer architecture ideas, so that students can have a better understanding of coding and the underlying machine language.”

Use cases:

ADD: 
    Actor: Add Function

        5. Return the quotient to accumulator

BRANCHNEG:
    Actor: BranchNeg
    System: Main program
    Goal: To successfully branch to a memory address when the value in the accumulator is negative

    Steps: 
        1. Parse function code for the operation instruction and memory address
        2. Check if the value in accumulator is negative
        3. If it is, branch to the memory address. If not, return to the current index and continue execution

        1.Parse function code for the operation instruction and memory address.
        2.Find word in memory location.
        3.Print value to console.

STORE:
    Actor: Store Function
    System: Main Program
    Goal: To take the current accumulator value and store that value in a provided memory location.
    Steps:
        1. Parse function code for operation instruction and memory address.
        2. Find memory address. 
        3. Replace data at that location with the current accumulator value.

LOAD:
    Actor: Load Function
    System: Main Function
    Goal: To replace the current accumulator value with the value contained at the provided memory address.
    Steps:
        1. Parse function code for operation instruction and memory address.
        2. Find memory address. 
        3. Replace current accumulator value with the value stored at the memory location.

    Goal: To unconditionally jump to a specified memory location and execute the commands found there.
    Steps:
        1. Parse function code for operation instruction and memory address. 
        2. Subtract one from the provided memory location to account for the main function loop adding one after this command is finished.
        3. Return modified target location to update the i value in main.

SUBTRACT:
    Actor: Subtract Function
    System: Main Program
    Goal: To successfully subtract a word from the word currently stored in the accumulator
    Steps: 
        1. Parse function code for the operation instruction and memory address
        2. Subtract the word in the memory address from the word in the accumulator
        3. Return the difference to accumulator
